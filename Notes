Amethyst

World:
AmethystOre - Amethyst
Aluminum - Bauxite - cans, utencils, good conductor, transmission lines, 
Copper - chalcopyrite, Chalcocite, Bornite, covellite, tetrahedrite, enargite - wiring and motor, machinery and construction, 
Zinc - sphalerite - galvanize, brass, nickel silver and aluminium solder.
Silver - argentite (Ag2S), chlorargyrite ("horn silver," AgCl), and galena - solder electrical contacts and batteries, printed circuits
Silicon from quartz(silica)
Tin - coat metal to prevent corrosion
Lead - car batteries, pigments, ammunition, cable sheathing, radiation protection
Lithium - from brine - rechargable batteries, A magnesium-lithium alloy is used for armour plating. Aluminium-lithium alloys are used in aircraft, bicycle frames and high-speed trains.
nickel - steel alloy - resist corrosion, stainless steel, boat propeller shafts and turbine blades., nickel-cadmium batteries and nickel-metal hydride batteries
sulphur - from gas and oil - gunpowder, sulfuric acid

Iron - steel, pipes valves and pumps
Stainless steel is very resistant to corrosion. It contains at least 10.5% chromium. Other metals such as nickel, molybdenum, titanium and copper are added to enhance its strength and workability. It is used in architecture, bearings, cutlery, surgical instruments and jewellery.
Gold - electroplate electric component, circuits, coat copper components, 

Metallurgical grade
+ anhydrous HCl in fluidized bed reactor -> distillation used to purify from other halides
+hydrogen at 1100 celsius for 200-300 hrs => very pure silicon


Copper + zinc = brass => locks gears ammunition casing valves.

Magical processors

Crafting:
Etching plate
ferric chloride

transfer paper
assembly table
+ drill = drill press
Drills
capacitor, resistor, diode, transistor, 
soldering iron

Steelmaking:

blast furnace => iron ore, coke(also pet coke), and limestone. Charcoal and anthracite to produce pig iron

Refractory lined container, ladle
magnesium added, exothermic to reduct sulfur inpurities
de-silicon and phosphorous with iron oxide(mill scale) and lime

filling the furnace => charging 1/5 steel scrap,  4% C, 0.2–0.8% Si, 0.08%–0.18% P, and 0.01–0.04% S

water cooled lance blowes oxygen, igniting carbon impurities and raise temperature to 1700 cel -> melts scrap
Fluxes (burnt lime or dolomite) are fed into the vessel to form slag, absorb impurities
typical =  0.3–0.6% C, 0.05–0.1% Mn, 0.01–0.03% Si, 0.01–0.03% S and P.

poured in to ladle and alloy

Basic Oxygen Furnace 
manganese, nickel, chromium and vanadium are added to produce steel

electric arc furnace

method to purify aluminum
Bayer process https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process
wash bauxite with NaOH at 175 cel under pressure, convert aluminum oxide to sodium aluminate produce water as well
rotary sand trap to filter out red mud with flocculant
water + seed with AlOH3 to produce AlOH3 crystal and NaOH
heat to 980 cel, decompose to aluminum oxide and water

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall–Héroult_process
to smelt aluminum
dissolve in molten cryolite, Na3AlF6 lower melting point and improve conductivity

cryolite, alumina and aluminium fluoride is electrolyzed by passing low voltage (3-5V) direct current through it.

deposited at the cathode while the oxygen from the alumina combines with carbon from the anode to produce carbon dioxide

Initial Mana Max. = 40-60

Spell Stages: Pre-initiation, Initiation, prefix, Casting, suffix

Pre-initiation:
Preemption Caster (significantly decreases total spell time) (significantly decreases power) (significantly increases energy usage)
Force Caster (significantly increases total spell time) (significantly increases power) (significantly increases mana usage)
Amateur Caster (increases total spell time) (decreases mana/energy usage)
Intermediate Caster (does nothing)

Initiation:
Instantaneous Spell (short period of time) (short initiation time)
Lasting Spell (does not change over time, unless stopped) (long initiation time)
Miscellaneous Spell (anything) (Hidden) (unknown)
Ancient Spell (anything) (Hidden) (unknown)

Prefix:
Augmentation prefix (amplifies the power/visibility of the spell) (increases energy and mana usage) (increases casting time)
Scope prefix (increases the range of the spell) (significantly increases energy and mana usage) (increases casting time)
Reduction prefix (diminishes the power/visibility of the spell) (decreases energy and mana usage) (decreases casting time)
Precision prefix (improved accuracy) (slightly increases energy and mana usage) (increases casting time)
Mundane prefix (slightly decreases accuracy or power of the spell) (decreases mana usage)

Suffix:
Frugal suffix (decreases energy usage) (increases casting time)
Celerity suffix (increases mana usage) (decreases casting time)
Instability suffix (slightly decreases energy or mana usage or accuracy) (slightly increases/decreases casting time) (unstable)
Stealth suffix (decreases the visibility of the spell) (increases casting time)
Mundane suffix (slightly decreases accuracy or power of the spell) (decreases mana usage)
